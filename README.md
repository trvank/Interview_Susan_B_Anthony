# Interview with Susan B. Anthony
This application allows users to interact with and ask questions to Susan B. Anthony about her life and some of her major accomplishments. Some of the topics that an interviewer might ask Susan about include: her work for Women's Suffrage, her arrest and trial, and the 19th amendment. If users are completely unfamiliar with this historical figure, they can tell her "I don't know who you are." or "What can I ask you about?" to get some topics to discuss.<br>
